The main purpose of this exercise is to implement a dynamic deep neural network and compare its results in two tasks with the same network architecture built by Pytorch/Tensorflow.
The tasks considered in this assignment are as follows: // First, we should accomplish a classification algorithm on the loan-eligible dataset and estimate whether a costumer can get a loan or not. Second, we should perform a regression to predict LoanAmount values for the test dataset.
