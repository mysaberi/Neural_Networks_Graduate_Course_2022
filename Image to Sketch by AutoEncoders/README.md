Autoencoders are used for denoising data, image colorization, data compression, image generation and many more tasks.
Through the process of compressing input data, encoding it, and then reconstructing it as an output,
autoencoders allow you to reduce dimensionality and focus only on areas of real value.
Every Autoencoder have two main parts. An encoder and a decoder. </br>
The encoder part converts the input data into a latent vector which is only comprehendible by machines.</br>
The decoder part reconstructs the desired output out of the latent vector.  </br>
In this project we are keen to use Autoencoders as a system which converts images to sketches.
The models inside this report were run on GTX 1050ti with 2.4 GB available GPU ram.
