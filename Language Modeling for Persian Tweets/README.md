Language modeling is a gateway into many deep learning applications, like speech recognition, image captioning and machine translation. Language modeling is the process of assigning probabilities to sequences of words. So, language modeling could analyze a sequence of words and predict which word is most probable to come next. </br>
In this project, we are going to build such a system based on Persian tweets to predict the next word given a token.
